# Hotel Booking Data Analysis

This project performs an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on **119k+ hotel booking records** to identify cancellation patterns, customer behavior, and key business insights. The analysis was carried out using **Excel PivotTables, Conditional Formatting, and Excel-based visual exploration**.

The goal of this analysis is to understand:
- Why customers cancel hotel bookings  
- Which hotel types have higher cancellation rates  
- How seasonality and demand affect booking patterns  
- What actionable strategies can reduce cancellations and improve customer retention  

This project is fully Excel-driven and demonstrates the ability to clean, analyze, visualize, and interpret large datasets using spreadsheet-based analytics.
